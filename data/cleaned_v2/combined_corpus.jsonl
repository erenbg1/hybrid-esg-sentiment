It also mentions notable targets set in 2022.\nThis report outlines how we're driving positive environmental impact throughout our business in five key ways: designing efficient data centers, advancing carbon-free energy, creating sustainable workplaces, building better devices and services, and empowering users with technology.\nFor more information about our sustainability strategy, see Google's Sustainability website and sustainability reports page. For more information about our overall corporate responsibility initiatives, see Google's commitments, as well as sustainability and related information. For more information about our business, see the About Google and Alphabet Investor Relations websites.\nGoogle Environmental Report 2022 1 Our approach We believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of our core values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do.\nWe've been a leader on sustainability and climate change since Google's founding over 20 years ago. These are some of our key achievements over the past two decades: 2007: We became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations.\n2017: We became the first major company to match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewable energy, which we've achieved for five consecutive years.\n2020: We issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds - the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any company in history at the time.\n2021: We matched 66% of our data center electricity use with regional carbon-free sources, on an hourly basis.\nOur sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a circular economy, empowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and places where we operate (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1 SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY OVERVIEW We strive to build sustainability into everything we do Accelerate carbon-free Empower with Benefit people and circular technology and places Decouple business growth Tackle major sustainability problems Share benefits with the from the growth of carbon and drive net-positive impact using communities of our facilities, intensity and material use Google technologies, platforms, users, partners, and suppliers products, and services Google Environmental Report 2022 2 Accelerating carbon-free and circular To accelerate the transition to a carbon-free and circular economy, in 2020, we launched our third decade of climate action, and we're now working toward a new set of ambitious goals. By 2030, we aim to: Achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, including our consumer hardware products Become the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year Enable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions Help more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually We also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and to enable others to do the same.\nAs part of our goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030, we aim to reduce the majority of our emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030 and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We know this will be a challenging journey and we expect our progress toward this goal to be nonlinear. While our total GHG emissions increased from 2020 to 2021, we're committed to achieving GHG reductions throughout our operations and value chain.\nGoogle Environmental Report 2022 3 Empowering everyone with technology To empower everyone with technology, we've committed to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by the end of 2022 through our core products. We introduced eco-friendly routing in Google Maps, new features to book flights or purchase appliances that have lower carbon footprints, and Nest Renew, a program to support clean energy from home. And when people come to Google Search with questions about climate change, we show information from authoritative sources like the United Nations.\nBenefiting people and places To benefit the people and places where we operate, we've set goals to replenish more water than we consume by 2030 and to support water security in communities where we operate. We're focused on three areas: enhancing our stewardship of water resources across Google offices and data centers; replenishing our water use and improving watershed health and ecosystems in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools that help everyone predict, prevent, and recover from water stress.\nAt Google, we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability, and we'll continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our planet. We're proud of what we've achieved so far, and we're energized to help move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all.\nGoogle Environmental Report 2022 4 Performance highlights The following section provides a snapshot of our performance as of the end of 2021 - demonstrating how we're strengthening our business by reducing the environmental impact of our operations and working to empower people everywhere to live more sustainably.\nFor a more complete overview of our performance over time, see the environmental data table.\nDESIGNING EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS Energy GHG emissions 2 5 1.10 0 X X as energy efficient as much computing power average annual PUE operational GHG emissions after compensations On average, a Google data center Compared with five years ago, In 2021, the average annual PUE2 is twice as energy efficient as a we now deliver around five times for our global fleet of data centers Whether someone is using Google typical enterprise data center.1 as much computing power with the was 1.10, compared with the industry at home or as part of an organization same amount of electrical power. average of 1.573 - meaning that running Google Cloud or Google Google data centers use about Workspace, all products in our Cloud six times less overhead energy. are carbon neutral - meaning that the operational GHG emissions associated with running workloads on our infrastructure have been reduced through procurement of renewable energy and any residual emissions have been compensated for with high-quality carbon credits.4 Waste 78 27 4.9 % % million of waste diverted of components refurbished components resold In 2021, we diverted 78% of waste In 2021, 27% of components In 2021, we resold more than from our global data center used for server upgrades were 4.9 million components into the operations away from landfills. refurbished inventory. secondary market for reuse by other organizations.\nGoogle Environmental Report 2022 5 ADVANCING CARBON-FREE ENERGY Energy Investment 7 100 73 3.3 % $ GW million MWh billion of renewable energy renewable energy of renewable energy in investment commitments From 2010 to 2021, we signed In 2021, we matched 100% Over the past decade, Google more than 60 agreements of the electricity consumption of purchased more renewable From 2010 to 2021, we made totaling more than 7 GW of our operations with renewable energy than any other company.6 commitments to invest nearly renewable energy.

According to Google's own analysis of our more efficient servers, power infrastructure, and cooling systems, compared with data center industry averages.\n2. PUE is a standard industry ratio that compares the amount of non-computing overhead energy (used for things like cooling and power distribution) to the amount of energy used to power IT equipment. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means nearly all the energy is used for computing.\n3. According to the Uptime Institute's 2021 Data Center Survey, the global average PUE of respondents' largest data centers was around 1.57.\n4. Carbon credits are reductions in GHG emissions made to compensate for emissions that occur elsewhere. For each metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced, one carbon credit is created. References to \"carbon offsets\" (as mentioned in prior reports) were updated to \"carbon credits\" starting in Google's 2021 Environmental Report. For more information on our approach to purchasing carbon credits, see our 2011 white paper, Google's Carbon Offsets: Collaboration and Due Diligence.\n5. This estimated spend commitment is for clean energy purchased for our operations. It may fluctuate over time based on the number of contracts signed and energy market prices.\n6. Based on our cumulative renewable electricity purchased in megawatt-hours (MWh) from 2012 to 2021.\n7. The first year Google signed a renewable energy contract was 2010.\n8. We procure high-quality carbon credits to compensate for the carbon emissions from all Google-owned shipments of consumer hardware, including to and from retail partners, distributors, and Google Store customers. Because shipping devices to customers falls outside the scope of Google's operations, these efforts go beyond Google's long-standing commitment to operational carbon neutrality.\n9. Energy Savings from the Nest Learning Thermostat: Energy Bill Analysis Results, Nest Labs, February 2015.\n10. Independent studies showed that Nest saved people an average of 10% to 12% on heating and 15% on cooling. Using typical energy costs, we've estimated average savings of $131 to $145 a year. That means the Nest Learning Thermostat can pay for itself in under two years. Individual savings are not guaranteed.\n11. Nest and Pixel devices are designed with 9%-68% recycled content across their respective plastic parts in 2020 and 2021. This does not include plastics in printed circuit boards, labels, cables, connectors, electronic components and modules, optical components, electrostatic discharge components, electromagnetic interference components, films, coatings, and adhesives. The aluminum in the enclosure of Pixel 5 is 100% recycled content. (Back housing only. Recycled aluminum is approximately 58% of the Pixel 5 enclosure based on weight.) The aluminum in the housing of Pixel 6 is 100% recycled content. (Recycled aluminum (in the housing and other recycled aluminum components) is approximately 14% of product based on weight.)\n12. Carbon footprint reduction claim based on third-party verified life cycle assessment. Recycled aluminum (in the housing and other recycled aluminum components) is approximately 14% of product based on weight.\n13. One petabyte is 1015 bytes, or 1 million gigabytes, of digital information. It's equal to approximately 2.5 months of uninterrupted, uncompressed, high-definition (1920 x 1080 pixels) video data.\n14. Google was the largest organization, in terms of electricity consumption, to achieve a 100% renewable energy match.\n15. For more details, see our 2021 white paper, Carbon-free Energy Performance at Google Data Centers.\n16. We reach operational carbon neutrality via three steps. First, we work to reduce our total energy consumption by pursuing aggressive energy efficiency initiatives. Second, we match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy. Third, we buy high-quality carbon credits for any remaining operational emissions we haven't yet eliminated.\n17. In this report, \"Bay Area headquarters\" refers to our operations in both Mountain View and Sunnyvale.\n18. Fitbit wearable devices were not included in the scope of these targets in 2021.\n19. Flagship consumer hardware products are products that can provide their main functionality without connection to another product. For example, this does not include accessories, such as earbuds or cases.\n20. Minimum percentage of recycled or renewable plastic content calculated as a percentage of total plastic (by weight) in all products manufactured in 2025. The following may be excluded from the calculation of percentage: printed circuit boards, labels, cables, connectors, electronic components and modules, optical components, electrostatic discharge components, electromagnetic interference components, films, coatings, and adhesives. Renewable content consists of plastic made from bio-based material.\n21. This does not include plastics in printed circuit boards, labels, cables, connectors, electronic components and modules, optical components, electrostatic discharge components, electromagnetic interference components, films, coatings, and adhesives.\n22. See note 11 above.\n23. Ernst & Young LLP reviewed select quantitative performance indicators for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. See the related Independent Accountants' Review Report. Prior to fiscal year 2019, another third party verified the following emissions: Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), Scope 2 (location-based), Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting), and biogenic. For more information, see our prior annual Environmental Reports.\n24. Alphabet's fiscal year is from January 1 to December 31.\n25. GHG emissions are calculated according to Greenhouse Gas Protocol standards and guidance, developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), including A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), Scope 2 Guidance, and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. For more information on our methodology, including a breakdown of Scope 3 categories, see Alphabet's CDP Climate Change Responses on Google's sustainability reports page.\n26. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources we own or over which we have operational control, such as company vehicles or generators at Google's offices and data centers.\nScope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the production of electricity we purchase to run our operations and the production of space heating for our offices. The location-based category reflects the average carbon intensity of the electric grids where our operations are located and thus where our energy consumption occurs. The market-based category incorporates our procurement choices, i.e., our renewable energy purchases via contractual mechanisms like PPAs. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from other sources in our value chain, such as business travel or our suppliers.\n27. COe is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of carbon dioxide that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), i.e., the ability of a gas to trap heat in the atmosphere when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years). Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP. Carbon dioxide is the baseline and thus has a GWP of 1.\n28. Since 2010, we've procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall emissions. Until 2015, there was no guidance from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity procured against electricity consumed (in megawatt-hours) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project. In 2015, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol released updated Scope 2 guidance for the accounting of purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling, which we adopted, starting with 2015 data.\n29. Google currently buys enough renewable energy to match our annual global electricity consumption. To achieve our 100% renewable energy match goal, we first consider both our on-site renewable energy generation and the renewable energy that is already in the electric grids where our facilities are located, then procure renewable energy through PPA contracts. We have a few facilities located in geographies where we're not currently able to source large volumes of renewable energy, so we currently make up for this by buying surplus renewable energy in regions where it's abundant. For example, by buying larger amounts of wind energy in places like Europe, we compensate for our lack of renewable energy purchases in Asia. This approach results in Google's Scope 2 market-based emissions being greater than zero as per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, despite us achieving our 100% renewable energy match globally. To work toward eliminating GHG emissions associated with our electricity use (Scope 2 market-based emissions), we set the ambitious goal of achieving 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030. To attain this, we're evolving from matching our annual energy consumption with renewable energy to sourcing carbon-free energy every hour of every day, everywhere.\n30. See note 25 above.\nGoogle Environmental Report 2022 14\n31. In 2018, to align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, we extended our reporting boundaries to include emissions associated with food served in our offices, hardware manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Google's hardware includes data center servers, networking equipment, and consumer hardware products. These extended categories have been reported annually from 2018 onward.\n32. In 2020, due to the global pandemic, we began to estimate and report on our emissions associated with teleworking (i.e., employees working remotely). We applied the estimation methodology outlined in EcoAct's Homeworking Emissions Whitepaper to our annual average workforce to estimate the GHG emissions generated by employees working remotely from their homes. Teleworking emissions are reported as part of our Scope 3 emissions for employee commuting, per Greenhouse Gas Protocol's Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0). For a breakdown of our operational Scope 3 emissions by category, see our 2021 Independent Accountants' Review Report.\n33. In 2020, we began reporting teleworking emissions as part of our Scope 3 employee commuting emissions. Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting) emissions reported prior to 2020 do not include teleworking emissions.\n34. See note 31 above.\n35. We calculate two metrics for operational emissions, one using market-based Scope 2 and one using location-based Scope 2. The Scope 2 market-based and location-based amounts have been third-party assured by Ernst & Young LLP, as shown in the Schedule of Select Environmental Indicators attached to the 2021 Independent Accountants' Review Report.\nIn the 2021 Independent Accountants' Review Report, the Schedule of Operational GHG emissions After Compensation Adjustments only includes the market-based metric.\n36. In 2016, we adopted the industry practice of including only operational emissions in our carbon neutrality commitment. For more information, see our 2017 white paper, 10 Years of Carbon Neutrality. In 2020, we extended our operational emissions boundary to include teleworking emissions. The operational emissions included in our carbon neutrality commitment now include Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting, including teleworking).\n37. Emissions reduced by renewable energy PPAs are calculated by subtracting Scope 2 market-based method (MBM) GHG emissions from Scope 2 location-based method GHG emissions, thereby representing emissions reductions from renewable energy PPAs and MBM emission factors.\n38. See note 36 above.\n39. Carbon intensity metrics are based on gross global combined Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions. For more information on year-over-year changes to market-based Scope 2 emissions, see note 29 above.\n40. Total energy consumption includes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased electricity, purchased heating, and all electricity generated on-site from renewable sources.\n41. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, comparing the volume of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations (i.e., renewable energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and renewable energy in the electric grids where our facilities are located) with the total volume of electricity consumed by our operations. This metric includes all renewable energy purchased, regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed.\nPrior to 2016, we were not accounting for the renewable electricity purchased through grid electricity.\n42. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol's Scope 2 Guidance requires energy attribute certificates to be sourced from and applied to the same market in which the reporting entity's electricity-consuming operations are located. This guidance does not recognize existing renewable energy on the electric grids where an entity's operations are located.\n43. Our carbon-free energy (CFE) percentage measures the degree to which our electricity consumption on a given regional grid is matched with CFE on an hourly basis. This is calculated using both CFE under contract by Google as well as CFE coming from the overall grid mix. CFE coming from the overall grid mix is based on data obtained from a third-party, electricityMap, and has not been assured. For more information, see our 2021 white paper, 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy: Methodologies and Metrics.\n44. Landfill diversion is calculated as waste diverted to a more sustainable pathway than landfill or incineration without energy recovery.\n45. In 2020, pre-consumer food waste prevented in our cafés was tracked only from January to March due to limited café operations during the global pandemic.\n46. In 2021, we continued to experience limited café operations due to the global pandemic. As a result, we were unable to update our cumulative total for pre-consumer food waste prevented in our cafés.\n47. In 2021, there was less inventory to be resold due to market shortages and the continued impact of the global pandemic.\n48. In 2019, we aligned our water reporting with industry standards to disclose three water indicators: total water withdrawal, consumption, and discharge. Data for total water consumption and total water discharge is not available for prior years.\n49. Our reported water withdrawal, water consumption, and water discharge metrics do not include seawater.\n50. 2018 is the first year that reflects a refinement in Green Business Certification Inc.'s methodology for determining LEED-certified office space.\n51. This figure indicates the number of ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States and Canada, which represent the majority of our EV charging ports in those countries.\n52. Emissions avoided are estimated using data from the reported ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States and Canada only. While Google's total number of installed EV charging ports in the United States and Canada increased in 2020, the ports experienced limited use from March to December due to the global pandemic, resulting in a decrease in emissions avoided due to employee EV commuting that year. In 2021, EV charging ports continued to experience limited use due to office closures and related decreases in employee EV commuting.\n53. Due to the global pandemic, our Google shuttle buses in the Bay Area were in operation only from January to March in 2020 and from July to December in 2021.\n54. See note 53 above.\n55. See note 53 above.\n56. All ecology projects that were scheduled for completion in 2020 were delayed due to the global pandemic.\n57. See note 56 above.\n58. In addition to our renewable energy contracts, Google also invests in renewable energy projects around the world that are not used to directly mitigate our emissions. This indicator represents the expected combined capacity of contracted renewable energy projects in which we have an equity investment, even if we're a minority owner.\n59. Project Sunroof metrics have been incorporated into updates for the Environmental Insights Explorer. See the tool for more information about rooftop solar potential data.\n60. We updated the unit of this key performance indicator from \"cities\" in prior reports to \"cities and regions.\" This change more accurately describes the data boundaries for the Environmental Insights Explorer and does not represent a change in underlying methodology or related calculations.\nGlossary CFE: carbon-free energy kWh: kilowatt-hour COe: carbon dioxide equivalent lb: pound EV: electric vehicle LEED: Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ft: foot m: meter FTE: full-time equivalent MBM: market-based method GHG: greenhouse gas MW: megawatt GW: gigawatt MWh: megawatt-hour GWh: gigawatt-hour PPA: power purchase agreement GWP: global warming potential PUE: power usage effectiveness ILFI: International Living Future Institute tCO: metric tons of carbon dioxide ISO: International Organization for Standardization tCOe: metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent kg: kilogram WBCSD: World Business Council for Sustainable Development km: kilometer WRI: World Resources Institute Google Environmental Report 2022 15 Google Environmental Report 2022 June 2022 On the cover: Google Earth image of Azores, Portugal ©2022 CNES / Airbus, Maxar Technologies, SRHT"}

During our analysis we noted significant data gaps in reported emissions and data from external vendors at the company level. For scope 1 emissions, which are typically the easiest to source, we would have needed to have made estimates using outstanding amounts rather than production or revenue indicators, which would have resulted in the least accurate data quality scoring. We have therefore chosen to defer setting a baseline and target for this sector until there is sufficient reliable data to support our work, allowing us to more accurately set a baseline and track progress towards net zero. We will continue to engage with strategic clients within the sector to encourage disclosure and discuss their transition plans. We believe the shipping industry will require significant policy support and innovation to allow for the use of lower emissions fuels in existing as well as new ships. On the supply side, the provision of low-carbon fuels will need to increase sufficiently to meet this new demand.\n54 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2022 ESG review Environmental Financed emissions continued Financed emissions The table below summarises the results of our assessment of financed emissions using 2019 and 2020 data.\nOn-balance sheet financed emissions - wholesale credit lending and project finance1,2 PCAF data quality score3,† Scope 1-2 Scope 3 Emissions Scope 1 Sector Year (Mt CO 2 )† (Mt CO 2 )† intensity and 2 Scope 3 Oil and gas4, 5 2019 3.7 29.3 72.2 2.7 2.9 2020 3.3 26.8 71 2.7 2.9 Power and utilities4,5 2019 12.1 N/A 589.9 3.3 N/A 2020 11.8 N/A 509.6 3.2 N/A Cement 2019 2.2 N/A 0.64 2.2 N/A 2020 1.3 N/A 0.64 2.3 N/A Iron, steel and aluminium 2019 3.2 N/A 1.8 2.5 N/A 2020 2.7 N/A 2 2.8 N/A Aviation 2019 6.2 0.11 84 2.8 2.8 2020 4.9 0.08 103.9 2.6 3 Automotive 2019 0.11 4.0 191.5 3.3 3.4 2020 0.14 4.9 176.2 3.2 3.3 1 Total amount of short-term finance excluded for all sectors listed is $9.3bn in 2019 and $7.6bn in 2020 2 Total loans and advances analysed in 2019 were $38.3bn representing 1.7% of wholesale credit and lending and project finance at 31 December 2019, and in 2020 were $34.7bn representing 1.7% of wholesale credit and lending and project finance at 31 December 2020.\n3 PCAF scores where 1 is high and 5 is low.

We have chosen to defer setting targets for facilitated emissions until the PCAF standard for capital markets is published, which is expected in 2023. We had intended to disclose facilitated emissions for 2019 and 2020 for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors for transparency, as we did last year. However, following internal and external assurance reviews performed during the year, we identified certain data and process limitations and have deferred the publication of our facilitated emissions for 2019 and 2020 for these two sectors while additional verification procedures are performed. We aim to provide these disclosures as soon as practicable in 2023.\nWe continue to monitor the developments in industry standards for the publication of such emissions and associated targets, and, as mentioned above, we will seek to align to the PCAF standard when published.

We acknowledge that our systems, processes, controls and governance are developing.\n- We continue to develop how we produce our climate scenario analysis exercises so that we can have a more comprehensive understanding of climate headwinds, risks and opportunities that will support our Page 67 strategic planning and actions.\n- We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, and Page 423 particularly the impact of climate-related issues on our financial performance and financial position.\nIn addition, we have considered the impact of climate-related issues on our businesses, strategy, and financial planning, but not specifically in relation to acquisitions/divestments. Due to transitional challenges such as process limitations, we do not disclose the climate-related impact in these areas.\nWe expect to further enhance our disclosure and processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments in the medium term.\n- We have considered the impact of climate-related issues on our businesses, strategy, and financial Page 423 planning. Our access to capital may be impacted by reputational concerns as a result of climate action or inaction. In addition, if we are perceived to mislead stakeholders on our business activities or if we fail to achieve our stated net zero ambitions, we could face greenwashing risk resulting in significant reputational damage, impacting our revenue generating ability and potentially our access to capital.\nImpact on products and services - We aim to help our customers' transition to net zero and a sustainable future through providing Page 58 and facilitating between $750bn and $1tn of sustainable finance and investment by 2030.\nImpact on supply chain and/or value chain - We will continue to engage with our supply chain through CDP, and through direct discussions Page 62 with our suppliers on how they can further support our transition to net zero.\n- We also have significant responsibilities in relation to asset ownership by our insurance business, employee pension plans and asset management business.\nImpact on adaptation and mitigation - In October 2020, we announced our ambition to reduce our energy consumption by 50% by Page 62 activities 2030, against a 2019 baseline. As part of our ambition to achieve 100% renewable power across our operations by 2030, we continue to look for opportunities to procure green energy in each of our markets. A key challenge remains the limited opportunity to pursue power purchase agreements or green tariffs in key markets due to regulations.\nImpact on operations - Climate change poses a physical risk to the buildings that we occupy as an organisation, Page 229 including our offices, retail branches and data centres.\n- We use stress testing to evaluate the potential for impact to our owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2022, analysed how seven different climate change-related hazards - comprising coastal inundation, extreme heat, extreme winds, wildfires, riverine flooding, soil movement due to drought, and surface water flooding - could impact 500 of our critical and important buildings.\nImpact on investment in research and - Our Climate Solutions Partnership is a five-year $100m philanthropic initiative that aims to Page 84 development identify and remove barriers to scale for climate change solutions. Working with the World Resources Institute, WWF and over 50 local partners, our support focuses on start-up companies developing carbon-cutting technologies, nature-based solutions, renewable energy initiatives in Asia and the WWF-led Asia Sustainable Palm Oil Links programme.\nHow we are striving to meet investor - During Board meetings, the Directors continued to balance discussions on the Group's Page 20 expectations performance, emerging risks and duties to shareholders, while remaining conscious of responsibilities to support communities and help customers.\n- In 2022, the Board approved an update to the thermal coal phase-out policy. It also approved the Page 23 publication of an updated energy policy.\nTransition plan to a low-carbon economy - We have committed to publish our own climate transition plan in 2023. This plan will outline, in Page 49 one place, not only our commitments, targets and approach to net zero across the sectors and markets we serve, but how we are transforming our organisation to embed net zero and finance the transition.\nc) Describe the resilience of the organisation's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario Embedding climate into scenario analysis - Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our position under a range of climate Page 67 scenarios. It helps to build our awareness of climate change, plan for the future and meet our and 226 growing regulatory requirements.\n- In 2022, we delivered our first internal climate scenario analysis exercise where we used four scenarios that were designed to articulate our view of the range of potential outcomes for global climate change. The analysis considered the key regions in which we operate, and assessed the impact on our balance sheet between the 2022 and 2050 time period.\nKey drivers of performance and how these - Climate scenario analysis allows us to model how different potential climate pathways may Page 67 have been taken into account affect our customers and portfolios, particularly in respect of credit losses. Under the Current and 226 Commitments scenario, we expect moderate levels of losses relating to transition risks. However, the rise in global warming will lead to increasing levels of physical risk losses in later years.\n70 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2022 ESG review Environmental Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') continued Disclosure Recommendation Response location Scenarios used and how they factored in - The scenario assumptions used for our climate stress testing exercise include varying levels of Page 226 government policies governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors and technological developments.\nHowever, these scenarios rely on the development of technologies that are still unproven, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonise aviation and shipping. For details of the assumptions, see the ESG Data Pack.\nHow our strategies may change and adapt - The nature of the scenarios, our developing capabilities, and limitations of the analysis lead Page 67 to outcomes that are indicative of climate change headwinds, although they are not a direct and 226 forecast.\n- Developments in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us shape our approach further. We therefore expect this view of risk to change over time.\n- We plan to continue to enhance our capabilities for climate scenario analysis and use the results for decision making, particularly in respect of strategy, by using the range of scenario analysis Page 67 outcomes to shape our strategy across business and regions.\n- We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively, due to transitional challenges including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies. Page 423 Risk management a) Describe the organisation's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks Traditional banking risk types considered - Our initial approach to managing climate risk was focused on understanding physical and P age 221 transition impacts across five priority risk types: wholesale credit risk, retail credit risk, reputational risk, resilience risk and regulatory compliance risk.\nProcess - We have integrated climate risk into our existing risk taxonomy, and incorporated it within the Page 47 risk management framework through the policies and controls for the existing risks where and 221 appropriate. We also recognise that we require enhanced capabilities and new sources of data.\n- We consider greenwashing to be an important emerging risk that is likely to increase over time, as we look to develop capabilities and products to achieve our net zero commitments, and work and 221 with our clients to help them transition to a low-carbon economy. We also recognise that green finance taxonomies are not consistent globally, and evolving taxonomies and practices could result in revisions in our sustainable finance reporting going forward.\n- We also use stress testing and scenario analysis to assess how these climate risks will impact our Page 46 customers, business and infrastructure.\nIntegration into policies and procedures - In 2022, we incorporated climate considerations into our UK mortgage origination process for Page 223 our retail mortgage business and new money request process for our key wholesale businesses.\nWe also continued to enhance our climate risk scoring tool, which will enable us to assess our customers' exposures to climate risk. We also published our updated energy policy, covering the oil and gas, power and utilities, hydrogen, renewables, nuclear and biomass sectors, as well as updated our thermal coal phase-out policy after its initial publication in 2021.\n- We are integrating climate risk into the policies, processes and controls across many areas of our organisation, and we will continue to update these as our climate risk management capabilities mature over time.\nConsider climate-related risks in traditional - In 2022, we expanded our scope to consider climate risk impacts on our other risk types P age 221 banking industry risk categories (including treasury risk and traded risk) in our risk taxonomy. and 226 (supplementary guidance for banks) - We also analysed in our internal scenario analysis exercise how climate risks impact how we manage other risks within our organisation, including credit risk, and on an exploratory basis: market, operational, liquidity, insurance, and pension risks.\nb) Describe the organisation's processes for managing climate-related risks Process and how we make decisions - The Group Risk Management Meeting and the Group Risk Committee receive regular updates on our Page 222 climate risk profile, top and emerging climate risks, and progress of our climate risk programme.\n- Our climate risk appetite supports the oversight and management of the financial and non-financial risks from climate change, and supports the business to deliver our climate ambition in a safe and and 223 sustainable way. We recognise that we require enhanced systems, processes, controls, governance and new sources of data.\nc) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organisation's overall risk management framework How we have aligned and integrated our - Our climate risk approach is aligned to our Group-wide risk management framework and three Page 221 approach lines of defence model, which sets out how we identify, assess, and manage our risks.\n- In February 2022, we refreshed a high-level assessment of how climate risk may impact risk types within the HSBC taxonomy over a 12-month horizon, and how the level of risk may increase over longer time horizons.\n- We developed our first internal climate scenario exercise, where we used four bespoke scenarios that were designed to articulate our view of the range of potential outcomes for global climate change.\nHow we take into account interconnections - Through our dedicated climate risk programme, we continued to embed climate considerations Page 135 between entities and functions throughout the organisation, including updating the scope of our programme to cover all risk types, expanding the scope of climate-related training, developing new climate risk metrics to monitor and manage exposures, and the development of our internal climate scenario exercise.\n- We updated our climate risk management approach to cover all risk types in our risk taxonomy. Page 222\n- We expanded the scope of climate-related training for employees to cover additional topics, such as greenwashing risk, and increased the availability of training to the broader workforce.\nESG review | Environmental Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') continued Disclosure Recommendation Response location Metrics and targets a) Disclose the metrics used by the organisation to assess climate-related risk and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process Metrics used to assess the impact of - We continue to disclose our wholesale loan exposure to the six high transition risk sectors, which Page 223 climate-related risks on our loan portfolio are automotive, chemicals, construction and building materials, metals and mining, oil and gas, and power and utilities. The wholesale loan exposure is used as a metric to assess impact of climate risk and help inform risk management, together with our transition risk questionnaire results.\n- We continue to measure climate risk in our most material mortgage market, which is the UK, where the primary physical risk facing properties is flooding. We also continue to identify the current and potential EPC ratings for individual properties within the UK mortgage portfolio.\nFor further details, see our ESG Data Pack.\n- Our climate risk management information dashboard includes metrics relating to our key climate risks, and is reported to the Global Climate Risk Oversight Forum. However, we do not fully disclose metrics used to assess the impact of climate-related risks on retail lending, parts of wholesale lending and other financial intermediary business activities.\nMetrics used to assess progress against - We continue to track our progress against our ambition to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of P age 18 opportunities sustainable finance and investment by 2030, aligned to our published data dictionary.

In addition, we do not currently disclose internal carbon prices due to transitional challenges such as data challenges. We recognise that we require enhanced systems, processes, controls, governance and new sources of data.\nBoard or senior management incentives - To help us achieve our ESG ambitions, a number of measures are included in the annual incentive Page 16 and long-term incentive scorecards of the Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Financial Officer and 286 and Group Executives.\nMetrics used to assess the impact of - As part of our internal climate scenario analysis, we carried out a detailed physical risk assessment of Page 224 climate risk on lending and financial four of our most material retail mortgage markets - the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia - intermediary business (supplemental which represent 73.8% of balances in our retail mortgage portfolio.

We aim to disclose financed emissions for Page 423 additional sectors in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 and related disclosures.\nc) Describe the targets used by the organisation to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets Details of targets set and whether they are - One of our strategic pillars is to support the transition to a net zero global economy. To support Page 18 absolute or intensity based our ambition to align our financed emissions to achieve net zero by 2050 or sooner, we have set interim 2030 targets for on-balance sheet financed emissions for eight sectors.\n- For financed emissions we do not plan to set 2025 targets. We set targets in line with the Net-Zero Page 423 Banking Alliance ('NZBA') guidelines by setting 2030 targets. In 2022, we disclose interim 2030 targets for on-balance sheet financed emissions for eight sectors.\n- We do not currently disclose targets used to measure and manage physical risk, or internal carbon price targets. This is due to transitional challenges and data limitations. But we considered physical risk and carbon prices as an input in the climate scenario analysis exercise. We expect to further enhance the disclosure in the medium term as more data becomes available. In addition, we do not currently disclose a target for capital deployment. In 2022, we are internally reviewing and enhancing the green bond framework, with further refinement to be undertaken in 2023. Our continued monitoring of evolving taxonomies and practices over time could result in revisions in our reporting going forward and lead to differences year-on-year as compared with prior years.\nWe do not consider water usage to be a material target for our business and therefore we have not included a target in this year's disclosure.\nOther key performance indicators used - We also use other indicators to assess our progress including energy consumption and Page 62 percentage of renewable electricity sourced.\n72 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2022 ESG review Social Social Building inclusion and resilience We aim to play an active role in opening up a world of opportunity for our customers, colleagues and communities as we bring the benefits of connectivity and global economy to more people around the world.\nAt a glance Our relationships We are equally committed to ensuring there Building inclusion and resilience can also Our purpose is opening up a world of are no unnecessary barriers to finance for our mean working to address gaps where we opportunity, and we aim to bring that customers.

Page 65 (supplemental guidance for banks) - HSBC Asset Management recognises that climate risk may manifest as transition and physical risks over the short, medium and long term. The impact of climate-related risk will vary depending on characteristics Page 65 such as asset class, sector, business model and geography. Where applicable and relevant, HSBC Asset Management incorporates climate-related indicators, such as carbon intensity and management of carbon emissions, into investment decisions as well as insights from its climate-related engagement.\n- In climate scenario analysis on page 227, we show the relative size of exposures at default in 2023 and the increase in cumulative ECL under each scenario compared with a counterfactual scenario by 2035 (expressed as a multiple).\n70 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 ESG review Environmental Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') continued Disclosure Recommendation Response location b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy and financial planning (Companies Act 2006 - Sections 414CA and 414CB 2A (e)) Impact on strategy, business, - Our net zero ambition represents one of our four strategic pillars. We aim to achieve net zero in our financed Page 44 and financial planning emissions by 2050, and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030.\n- Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our potential exposures to risks and vulnerabilities under a range of climate scenarios. It helps to build our awareness of climate change, plan for the future and meet Page 225 our growing regulatory requirements. Developments in climate science, data, methodology and scenario analysis techniques will help us shape our approach further. We therefore expect this view to change over time.\n- We continue to enhance our climate scenario analysis exercises so that we can have a more comprehensive Page 225 understanding of climate headwinds, risks and opportunities to support our strategic planning and actions.\n- We have used climate scenarios to inform our organisation's business, strategy and financial planning. In 2023, we continued to incorporate certain aspects of sustainable finance and financed emissions within our Page 222 financial planning process.\n- We do not fully disclose impacts from climate-related opportunities on financial planning and performance including on revenue, costs and the balance sheet, quantitative scenario analysis, detailed climate risk exposures for all sectors and geographies or physical risk metrics. This is due to transitional challenges in Page 440 relation to data limitations, although nascent work is ongoing in these areas. We expect these data limitations to be addressed in the medium term as more reliable data becomes available and technology solutions are implemented.\nImpact on products - We aim to help our customers transition to net zero and a sustainable future by providing and facilitating Page 50 and services between $750bn and $1tn of sustainable finance and investment by 2030.\nImpact on supply chain - We will continue to engage with our supply chain through CDP, and through direct discussions with our Page 63 and/or value chain suppliers on how they can further support our transition to net zero.\n- We recognise that collective action is critical to achieve net zero. We seek to collaborate with a range of partners to develop a supportive environment for achieving net zero and mobilising finance for climate action and nature-based solutions. Our partnerships vary in scope and form depending on the sector and geography, as well as our presence in local markets.\n- HSBC Asset Management engages with investee companies on a priority list as defined in its Global Stewardship Plan, and votes at company general meetings, including on the topic of climate change.\nImpact on adaptation and - In October 2020, we announced our ambition to reduce our energy consumption by 50% by 2030, against a Page 63 mitigation activities 2019 baseline. As part of our ambition to achieve 100% renewable electricity across our operations by 2030, we continue to look for opportunities to procure green electricity in each of our markets. In 2023, our fourth UK renewable PPA went live in Sorbie, Scotland. A key challenge remains the limited opportunity to pursue PPAs or green tariffs in key markets due to regulations.\n- We regularly review and enhance our building selection process and global engineering standards and will Page 229 continue to assess historical claims data to help ensure our building selection and design standards address the potential impacts of climate change.\nImpact on operations - We have three elements to our strategy: reduce, replace and remove. We plan to first focus on reducing Page 63 carbon emissions from consumption, and then replacing remaining emissions with low-carbon alternatives in line with the Paris Agreement. We plan to remove the remaining emissions that cannot be reduced or replaced by procuring, in accordance with prevailing regulatory requirements, high-quality offsets at a later stage.\n- We use stress testing to evaluate the potential for impact on our owned or leased premises. Our scenario Page 229 stress test, conducted in 2023, analysed how eight climate change-related hazards could impact 1,000 of our critical and important buildings. These hazards were coastal inundation, extreme heat, extreme winds, wildfires, riverine flooding, pluvial flooding, soil movement due to drought, and surface water flooding.\nImpact on investment in - Throughout 2023, we published regular ESG and sustainability-related market insights and updates such Page 51 research and development as #WhyESGMatters and Learning about ESG to help clients better understand the implications for their investments.\n- We recognise the need to find new solutions and increase the pace of change for the world to achieve the Page 52 Paris Agreement goal of being net zero by 2050. We are working with a range of partners to accelerate investment in sustainable infrastructure, natural resources and climate technology to help reduce emissions and address climate change.\nImpact on acquisitions - We have updated our merger and acquisition process to consider potential climate and sustainability-related Page 222 or divestments targets, net zero transition plans and climate strategy, and how this relates to HSBC.\nImpact on access to capital - We have considered the impact of climate-related issues on our businesses, strategy and financial planning. Page 440 Our access to capital may be impacted by reputational concerns as a result of climate action or inaction. In addition, if we are perceived to mislead stakeholders on our business activities or if we fail to achieve our stated net zero ambitions, we could face reputational damage, impacting our revenue-generating ability and potentially our access to capital markets. We expect to further enhance the disclosure in the medium term as more data becomes available. To manage these risks we have integrated climate risk into our existing risk taxonomy, and incorporated it within the risk management framework through the policies and controls for the existing risks where appropriate.\nTransition plan to a - We published our Group-wide net zero transition plan in January 2024. In this plan, we provided an overview Page 440 low-carbon economy of our approach to net zero and the actions we are taking to help meet our ambitions. We want to be clear about our approach, the change underway today and what we plan to do in the future. We also want to be transparent about where there are still unresolved issues and uncertainties. We are still developing our disclosures, including considerations of possible additional data in relation to our financial plans, budgets, and related financial approach for the implementation of the transition plan in the medium term (e.g. amount of capital and other expenditures supporting our decarbonisation strategy). The UK Transition Plan Taskforce published its final transition plan disclosure framework in October 2023. We will continue to evolve our transition plan disclosures to take into account new and evolving regulatory developments.\nESG review | Environmental Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') continued Disclosure Recommendation Response location c) Describe the resilience of the organisation's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario (Companies Act 2006 - Sections 414CA and 414CB 2A (f)) Embedding climate into - Scenario analysis supports our strategy by assessing our potential exposures to risks and vulnerabilities under Page 225 scenario analysis a range of climate scenarios. It helps to build our awareness of climate change, plan for the future and meet our growing regulatory requirements.\n- In our 2023 climate scenario analysis exercises, we explored five scenarios that were created to examine the Page 225 potential impacts from climate change for the Group and its entities.\nKey drivers of performance - Climate scenario analysis allows us to model how different potential climate pathways may affect and impact Page 227 and how these have been the resilience of our customers and our portfolios, particularly in respect of credit losses. Under the Current taken into account Commitments scenario, we expect lower levels of losses relating to transition risks, although we would expect an increase in the effects of climate-related physical risks over the longer term.\n- Scenario analysis results have been used to support the Group's ICAAP. This is an internal assessment of Page 229 the capital the Group needs to hold to meet the risks identified on a current and projected basis, including climate risk.\n- In addition, scenario analysis informs our risk appetite statement metrics. As an example, it supports the Page 229 calibration of physical risk metrics for our retail mortgage portfolios and it is used to consider climate impact in our IFRS 9 assessment.\nScenarios used and - Our scenarios are: the Net Zero scenario, the Current Commitments scenario, the Delayed Transition Risk Page 225 how they factored in scenario, the Downside Physical Risk scenario and the Near Term scenario.\ngovernment policies - Our scenarios reflect different levels of physical and transition risks over a variety of time periods. The scenario assumptions include varying levels of governmental climate policy changes, macroeconomic factors Page 225 and technological developments. However, these scenarios rely on the development of technologies that are still unproven, such as global hydrogen production to decarbonise aviation and shipping.\nHow our strategies may - The nature of the scenarios, our developing capabilities, and limitations of the analysis lead to outcomes that Page 225 change and adapt are indicative of climate change headwinds, although they are not a direct forecast.\n- Developments in climate science, data, methodology and scenario analysis techniques will help us shape our approach further. We therefore expect this view to change over time.\n- Climate scenario analysis plays a crucial role helping us to identify and understand the impact of climaterelated risks and potential opportunities as we navigate the transition to net zero. Page 229\n- Our target-setting approach to date, for on-balance sheet financed emissions and facilitated emissions, has been to utilise a single net zero reference scenario (IEA NZE 2021) to underpin both energy supply-related sectors (oil and gas, power and utilities, and thermal coal mining) and our published targets for demand-side Page 53 sectors in transport and heavy industry.\n- We recognise that the so-called 'hard-to-abate' sectors, such as cement, iron, steel and aluminium, and aviation have a large dependence on nascent technologies and the presence (or not) of enabling policies and Page 48 regulations. We may consider tracking progress relative to 1.5°C-aligned ambition ranges for these sectors in the future, which could include industry-specific scenarios alongside the IEA NZE scenario.\n- We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively, due to transitional challenges including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies. In 2023, we have disclosed the impairment impacts for our wholesale, retail and commercial real estate portfolios in different climate scenarios. In addition, we have disclosed losses on our retail mortgage book under three scenarios and Page 440 flood depths for specific markets. For our wholesale book, we have disclosed potential implications on our expected credit losses for 11 sectors under two scenarios. We have also disclosed a heat map showing how we expect the risks to evolve over time.\nRisk management a) Describe the organisation's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks (Companies Act 2006 - Sections 414CA and 414CB 2A (b)) Process - We continue to integrate climate risk into policies, processes and controls across many areas of our organisation, Page 222 and we will continue to update these as our climate risk management capabilities mature over time.\n- We updated our climate risk management approach to incorporate net zero alignment risk and developed guidance on how climate risk should be managed for non-financial risk types. While we have made progress in enhancing our climate risk framework, further work remains. This includes the need to develop additional metrics and tools to measure our exposure to climate-related risks, and to incorporate these tools within decision making.\n- In 2023, we enhanced our internal climate scenario analysis exercise by focusing our efforts on generating more granular insights for key sectors and regions to support core decision-making processes, and to respond to our Page 225 regulatory requirements. In climate scenario analysis, we consider, jointly, both physical risks and transition risks.\n- We continue to review policy implementation as we apply our policies in practice, and our operationalisation of such policies continues to be enhanced. We take a risk-based approach when identifying transactions and clients to which our energy and thermal coal phase-out policies apply, and when reporting on relevant exposures, adopting approaches proportionate to risk and materiality.\nIntegration into policies - We continue to integrate climate risk into policies, processes and controls across many areas of our Page 222 and procedures organisation, and we will continue to update these as our climate risk management capabilities mature over time.\nConsider climate-related risks - We provide further details of how we have embedded the management of climate risk across key risk Page 223 in traditional banking industry types, including wholesale credit risk, retail credit risk, treasury risk, traded risk, reputational risk, regulatory risk categories (supplementary compliance risk, resilience risk, model risk, and financial reporting risk.\nguidance for banks) 72 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 ESG review Environmental Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') continued Disclosure Recommendation Response location b) Describe the organisation's processes for managing climate-related risks (Companies Act 2006 - Sections 414CA and 414CB 2A (b)) Process and how we - The Group Risk Management Meeting and the Group Risk Committee receive regular updates on our climate Page 222 make decisions risk profile and progress of our climate risk programme.\n- The Environmental Risk Oversight Forum (formerly the Climate Risk Oversight Forum) oversees risk activities relating to climate and sustainability risk management, including the transition and physical risks from climate Page 222 change.

We also developed risk metrics to monitor and manage exposures, and further enhanced our internal climate scenario analysis.\n- We continue to make progress in enhancing our climate risk capabilities, and recognise it is a long-term Page 221 iterative process. This includes updating our approach to reflect how the risks associated with climate change continue to evolve in the real world, and maturing how we embed climate risk factors into strategic planning, transactions and decision making across our businesses.\nMetrics and targets a) Disclose the metrics used by the organisation to assess climate-related risk and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process (Companies Act 2006 - Sections 414CA and 414CB 2A (h)) Metrics used to assess the - We have metrics in place to monitor the exposure of our wholesale corporate lending portfolio to six Page 223 impact of climate-related risks high transition risk sectors. As at 31 December 2023, the overall exposure to six high transition risk sectors on our loan portfolio was $112bn.\n- The UK is our largest mortgage market, which at September 2023 made up 40.0% of our global mortgage Page 224 portfolio. We estimate that 0.2% of our UK retail mortgage portfolio is at very high risk of flooding, and 3.5% is at high risk. This is based on approximately 94.2% climate risk data coverage by value of our UK portfolio as at September 2023.\n- In 2023, we further developed our risk metrics to monitor our performance against our net zero targets for Page 222 both financed emissions and own operations.\nMetrics used to assess - We continue to track our progress against our ambition to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable P age 18 progress against opportunities finance and investment by 2030, aligned to our published data dictionary.

We are aiming to develop the appropriate systems, data and processes to provide these disclosures in future years. We disclose the exposure to six high transition risk wholesale sectors and the flood risk exposure and Energy Performance Certificate breakdown for the UK portfolio.\nESG review | Environmental Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') continued Disclosure Recommendation Response location b) Disclose scope 1, scope 2 and, if appropriate, scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions and the related risks (Companies Act 2006 - Sections 414CA and 414CB 2A (h)) Our own operations - We report greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the energy used in our buildings and employees' Page 64 business travel. In 2023, we also continue to disclose our scope 3 (category 1 and category 2) supply chain emissions. Our initial supply chain emission figures may require updating as data availability changes over time and methodologies and climate science evolve.\nGreenhouse gas emissions - Our analysis of financed emissions comprises 'on-balance sheet financed emissions' and 'facilitated Page 53 for lending and financial emissions'. Our on-balance sheet financed emissions include emissions related to on-balance sheet lending, intermediary business such as project finance and direct lending. Our facilitated emissions include emissions related to financing we (supplemental guidance help clients to raise through capital markets activities.\nfor banks) - Work continues on the integration of ESG and climate analysis into HSBC Asset Management's actively Page 65 managed product offerings to help ensure the climate risks faced by companies are considered when making investment decisions and to assess ESG risks and opportunities that could impact investment performance.\n- We currently disclose four out of 15 categories of scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions including business Page 440 travel, supply chain and financed emissions. In relation to financed emissions, we publish on-balance sheet financed emissions for a number of sectors as detailed on page 18. We also publish facilitated emissions for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors. Future disclosures on financed emissions and related risks are reliant on our customers publicly disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions, targets and plans, and related risks. We recognise the need to provide early transparency on climate disclosures but balance this with the recognition that existing data and reporting processes require significant enhancements.\nc) Describe the targets used by the organisation to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets (Companies Act 2006 - Sections 414CA and 414CB 2A (g)) Details of targets set and - We continue to track our progress against our ambition to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable Page 18 whether they are absolute or finance and investment by 2030, aligned to our published data dictionary.\nintensity based - We have continued to take steps to implement our climate ambition to become net zero in our operations and our supply chain by 2030, and align our financed emissions to net zero by 2050.\n- For financed emissions we do not plan to set 2025 targets. We set targets in line with the Net-Zero Banking Alliance ('NZBA') guidelines by setting 2030 targets. While the NZBA defines 2030 as intermediate, we use Page 17 different time horizons for climate risk management. For climate, we define short term as time periods up to 2025; medium term is between 2026 and 2035; and long term is between 2036 and 2050. These time periods align to the Climate Action 100+ disclosure framework. In 2023, we disclosed interim 2030 targets for financed emissions for a number of sectors as we outline on page 18.\n- We do not currently disclose a target for capital deployment. In relation to capital deployment, since 2015, we have issued more than $2bn of our own green bonds and structured green bonds with the capital invested into a variety of green projects, including: green buildings, renewable energy and clean transportation projects. In 2023, we further progressed our internal review and enhancement of the green bond framework, with further refinement including internal and external review to be undertaken in 2024. This will be subject to continuous review and monitoring to ensure that they remain up to date and reflect updated standards, taxonomies and best practices. Any such developments in standards, taxonomies and best practices over time could result in revisions in our reporting going forward and lead to differences year-on-year as compared to prior years. See the HSBC Green Bond Report for further information.\n- We do not currently disclose internal carbon pricing target due to transitional challenges such as developing Page 440 the appropriate systems and processes, but we considered carbon prices as an input for our climate scenario analysis exercise. We expect to further enhance the disclosure in the medium term as more data becomes available.\n- We do not currently disclose targets used to measure and manage physical risk. This is due to transitional challenges including data limitations of physical risk metrics. For retail, we do not use targets to measure and Page 440 manage physical risk. In 2023 we introduced internally a global 'soft trigger' monitoring and review process for physical risk exposure where a market reaches or exceeds a set threshold, as this ensures markets are actively considering their balance sheet risk exposure to peril events. We also consider physical and transition risk as an input for our climate scenario analysis exercise. We expect to further enhance our disclosures as our data, quantitative scenario analysis, risk metrics and physical risk targets evolve, and technology solutions are implemented in the medium term.\n- We have described the targets used by the organisation to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets. However, taking into account the nature of our business, we do not consider water usage to be a material target for our business and, therefore, we have not included a target in this year's disclosure.\nOther key performance - In October 2020, we announced our ambition to reduce our energy consumption by 50% by 2030, against a 2019 Page 63 indicators used baseline, and in 2023 we achieved 26.3%.\n- As part of our ambition to achieve 100% renewable electricity across our operations by 2030, we continue to look for opportunities to procure green electricity in each of our markets. In 2023, our fourth UK renewable PPA went live in Sorbie, Scotland.\n74 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 ESG review Social Social Building inclusion and resilience We play an active role in opening up a world of opportunity for our customers, colleagues and communities by connecting across our international networks to help build a more inclusive and resilient society.\nAt a glance Inclusion is key to opening up a world of making with women in senior leadership roles We build resilience by creating products and opportunity.

This data has enabled us to set locally relevant priorities and identify areas of our organisation where we need to focus our attention. We invite colleagues to self-identify on a broad range of data points where we can, although given the international nature of our business, there are some jurisdictions where we are unable to invite colleagues to share their diversity data with us. We have enabled 91% of our colleagues to disclose their ethnic background, with 62% of colleagues choosing to do so, where this is legally permissible.\nOur approach goes beyond ethnic heritage and considers broader representation within the workplace. We have enabled 90% of the workforce to share whether they have a disability, 71% of our workforce to share their sexual orientation, and all UK-based colleagues to share their socio-economic background.\nOur approach to Asian heritage representation Our roots as an organisation trace back over 150 years to Hong Kong, where HSBC opened its doors to serve clients with international needs. Asia remains a strategic focus for us today.\nTo better reflect the communities we serve, we have a focus on increasing representation across our global workforce, including Asian heritage representation. Defining Asian heritage can be complex due to the vast range of ethnicities and identities across the region. In 2023, 37.8% of our senior leaders were able to self-identify as being from an Asian heritage background. To deliver our international strategy it is vital that we are both representative of our local communities, and able to mobilise leaders with global perspective and diverse heritage backgrounds across our international network.\n76 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 ESG review Social Creating a diverse environment Women in senior leadership Black colleagues in senior leadership The programme encourages participants to Since achieving our ambition of having 30% We remain on track to double the number of support each other with the tools and shared of senior leadership positions held by women Black colleagues in senior leadership roles experiences to structure their careers, expand in 2020, we set a new goal to reach 35% by globally by 2025, having increased the number their network and seek job opportunities.

These form the basis of our menopause toolkit, which is available to all colleagues, and includes guidance on how to access menopause support and guidance for line managers on how to best support those in need.\nWe recognise that there is much more we can do to support those who are experiencing menopause and those who are supporting others experiencing it.

We encouraged leaders to post questions on our intranet to gather feedback from colleagues on their experiences and how we can improve mental health support. We surveyed our colleagues during the campaign and half said they were very satisfied with the mental health support HSBC offers. Supporting the mental health of our colleagues continues to be a priority, including ensuring that we continue to signpost how colleagues can access available support. Throughout 2023, we also held over 200 virtual events, featuring internal and external experts providing advice on mental health and topics related to well-being.\nESG review | Social Listening to our colleagues continued Employee engagement We use eight Snapshot indices to measure key areas of focus and compare against peer institutions.

Emissions intensity is a weighted average according to the portfolio weight of each investment, as a proportion of the total portfolio value. For oil and gas; and power and utilities, the baseline, progress and target figures represent combined on-balance sheet financed and facilitated emissions. For cement; iron, steel and aluminium; aviation; automotive; and thermal coal mining, the baseline, progress and target figures represent on-balance sheet financed emissions. For the aviation and automotive sectors, the target figure is unchanged while the 2022 figure represents restated on-balance sheet financed emissions. For thermal coal mining, the target is unchanged while the 2020 baseline figure has been re-baselined.\n2 For the oil and gas sector, absolute emissions are measured in million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent ('Mt COe'); for the power and utilities sector, intensity is measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per gigawatt hour ('tCOe/GWh'); for the cement sector, intensity is measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne of cement ('tCOe/t cement'); for the iron, steel and aluminium sector, intensity is measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne of metal ('tCOe/t metal'); for the aviation sector, intensity is measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per million revenue passenger kilometres ('tCOe/ 2 2 million rpk'); for the automotive sector, intensity is measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per million vehicle kilometres ('tCOe/million vkm'); and for the thermal coal mining sector, absolute emissions are measured in million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent ('Mt COe').\n3 While the iron, steel and aluminium 2030 target is aligned with the IEA NZE 2021 scenario, we also reference the Mission Possible Partnership Technology Moratorium scenario, whose 2030 reference range is shown in parentheses.\n4 Our aviation unit includes passenger and cargo tonnes, converted into revenue passenger kilometre ('rpk'), to align with our target pathway. This is comparable to revenue tonne kilometre ('rtk') using a 100kg per passenger conversion factor as we already include belly and dedicated cargo in our production figures. The conversion factor changed from 95kg per passenger used in the baseline disclosure to align with industry practice.\n5 The thermal coal mining scope differs from the other sectors.

By consistently measuring customer experience, we actively listen, learn and take action based on what our customers share with us. Additionally, we introduced a customer experience behavioural framework across the bank, aligned with HSBC's core values.

The Board has oversight of climate-related matters and monitors progress toward related goals. The Board is responsible for the Company's strategy and organization and provides oversight of its financial and non-financial performance and reporting. The Board approves the Company's ESG/sustainability strategy and approves its CSV and Sustainability Report for submission to the Annual General Meeting.\nManagement's role Page 4 The Executive Board is responsible for executing sustainability strategies, including our Net Zero Roadmap, through an ESG & Sustainability Council. At an operational level, an ESG Strategy and Deployment Unit drives implementation.\nStrategy Climate-related risks and opportunities Pages 9 to 19 Climate change is considered a material risk for Nestlé. Within our Enterprise Risk Management framework, we conduct an annual assessment of climate change risks and review the strategy and plans to mitigate them. We assess related financial risks using a discounted cash flow methodology.\nImpacts of climate-related risks and opportunities Pages 9 to 11 Our assessment establishes: Resilience of the organization's strategy Pages 9 to 11\n- Transition risks: we have assessed transition risks to 2030, based on exposure levels from low-, intermediate- and high-emission pathways. Modeling results show a degree of exposure, but our Net Zero Roadmap could reduce this by up to half.\nRisk management - Physical risks: changing temperatures and weather extremes can affect the quality and availability of key raw materials through lower and variable yields, as well as shifts in the regions suitable for cultivation. For 12 key ingredients covering 90% of our spend, we estimated the yield change in 2040 versus today in a 'steady-state', intermediate climate scenario Processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks Pages 9 to 11 (+2 to 3 °C by 2100), discounting the unpredictable impacts of extreme events.\nProcesses for managing climate-related risks Pages 9 to 11 Nestlé is well positioned to implement nature-based solutions for less resource-intense and more resilient food production, as it has direct access to more than 500 000 farmers. One Integration into the organization's overall risk management Pages 9 to 11 significant example is Nescafé Plan 2030, which aims to help drive regenerative agriculture, reduce GHG emissions and improve farmers' livelihoods.\nTargets Targets used to manage climate-related risks, opportunities Pages 7 and 8 We review our Net Zero Roadmap for achieving planned GHG emissions reductions for 2025 and 2030 annually to validate that our activities are keeping us on the path to net zero and are and performance helping mitigate and adapt to climate risk throughout our value chain.\nIn 2023, we used the following indicator for the first time: Net reduction of GHG emissions vs. 2018 baseline (%). Previously absolute amount of reductions and removals vs. Business As Usual was used as an indicator.

Twenty years ago, the concept was articulated when Nestlé worked with FSG, a social impact consulting firm led by Michael Porter and Mark Kramer, on a report documenting Nestlé's contribution to society in Latin America. Creating Shared Launched in May 2024, the Nescafé Gold refill paper pack Value was the suggested name for this new approach.\nis fully recyclable and uses Subsequently, the concept was defined more rigorously 97% less packaging weight and the term adopted company-wide. compared to our Nescafé Gold Blend 200g jars.

Where this could be the same great taste and aroma.\nachieved, there was considerable potential for companies to contribute more strongly to sustainable global growth.

All of these issues affect our business. Developing solutions to OUR REGENERATION WHEEL: HOW WE CREATE SHARED VALUE address them can create opportunities for faster growth and lower costs for Nestlé. Creating Shared Value is a strategy for improving corporate returns as well as addressing society's problems. It also helps to build trust.\nTrust is paramount for a fast-moving consumer goods company of our size and our scale. We need to earn the trust of consumers and other stakeholders every day.\nThe challenges listed above are all interconnected.\nNestlé's efforts to help address them are holistic. We use what we call our regeneration wheel to show how the different areas where we work on Creating Shared Value are interconnected. It reflects our aim to deliver value for people and pets, communities and the planet while ensuring our long-term business success.\nThe chapters in this book follow the same logic. Although each covers a different area - People, families and pets, People and planet and People in communities - they can be read together as part of one narrative, reflecting the holistic approach we take. Our Creating Shared Value principles are key to building a food system that meets the needs of people, while aiming to safeguard our planet for future generations.\nSound governance We want to be the trusted leader in our sector. Building our business on clear principles and sound governance helps maintain trust in the Nestlé brand and reduce risk throughout our value chain. You can read more about our sustainability governance structure in the Non-Financial Statement 2024.

For example, Henri Nestlé's 'farine lactée' (flour with milk) of people to access affordable and nutritious food and product was created for infants who beverages.\ncouldn't be breastfed, to tackle high mortality rates.\nAccess to food and beverages, coupled with sound nutrition, is fundamental to supporting good health, wellbeing and quality of life for all. The consequences of nutritional imbalance, whether excess or deficiency, can be detrimental. A balanced approach to nutrition is more than just avoidance of excess - it ensures that people receive the essential nutrients their bodies require for growth, development and optimal functioning, tailored to their life stages and lifestyles. Access to nutritious food and beverages also has an impact on social and economic stability. Food insecurity leads to increased healthcare costs, diminished productivity and greater reliance on social services. By helping to support access to high-quality, safe food and beverages, we aim to foster healthier communities.\nGrowing and evolving our portfolio Nestlé offers an extensive array of products and services across multiple categories, including Powdered and Our values: a strong commitment scientific research as the bedrock of product develop- Liquid Beverages, PetCare, Nutrition and Health Science, to better nutrition ment that fostered health and wellness.

Many of PROGRESSIVELY IMPROVING OUR PRODUCTS BASED ON THEIR ROLE IN A BALANCED DIET our products are designed to accompany a meal and to be consumed with plenty of fresh foods.\nIn our pursuit of better products, we seek to enhance positive nutrients, minimize public health-sensitive nutrients and elevate taste. Nutrient profiling systems are used to steer both new product development and the reformulation of existing products, with the aim of improving nutrient density where possible. This can involve reducing sugar, sodium or saturated fat, or increasing protein, fiber and food groups like fruit, nuts, legumes and vegetables. Taste, texture, cost and sustainability are all important as we consider local dietary habits, population and individual needs and cultural contexts.\nGuiding people toward tasty and balanced diets Navigating the complexities of what constitutes a balanced diet, based on individual needs and access to food, is not easy: people find themselves falling short of *Based on FAO & WHO definition of healthy diet, 2024.\nwhere they would like to be, or wishing for clear guidance.\nWith our global scale and reach, Nestlé is uniquely positioned to help people understand more about balanced diets and healthy lifestyles.

With every 100 000 babies born, 43.5 mothers die. These are deaths that are often caused by preventable conditions like hypertension or sepsis.\nI've been a gynecologist for the last three years. From my practice in Quito, I see these challenges firsthand. Many women arrive at consultations with pre-existing conditions such as obesity, diabetes or hypertension - conditions that could be managed or prevented with the right care before pregnancy. But for many, the culture of routine medical check-ups simply doesn't exist, and our healthcare system is often reactive rather than proactive.\nThe new maternal health program - endorsed by PREIS School and Meyer University in Florence, and supported by Nestlé Nutrition Institute (NNI) - has been a transformative tool in helping to address these issues. It launched in 2023 to provide healthcare practitioners with a structured digital curriculum focused on maternal nutrition and early childhood development. For me, it was a game-changer. I access the modules via my mobile phone, and they are designed to fit around our With Nestlé's maternal health program, healthcare practitioners demanding schedules, enabling us to learn anywhere, like Dr. Andrea Cevallos are empowered to provide life-changing, anytime. Topics like prenatal nutrition and breastfeeding preventive care.\npractices are tailored to local contexts, offering insights we can immediately apply to patient care. By including input from renowned experts, the curriculum ensures we're learning from the best minds in the field, even if we're geographically remote.\nWhat sets this program apart is its emphasis on practical, preventive measures. Before participating, I felt 20 Creating Shared Value at Nestlé 2024 Creating Shared Value People, Families and Pets People and Planet People in Communities my training often focused more on solving problems in the emergency room rather than preventing them in the first place. Now, I can have deeper, more impactful conversations with patients, encouraging them to adopt healthier lifestyles and understand how nutrition impacts their pregnancies.\nMy patients have responded brilliantly. I've seen how empowered and informed mothers can change not just their own lives but also the well-being of their families and communities.\n\"This program isn't just about education - it's a partnership. By collaborating with international universities, local ministries and healthcare organizations, the program can be adapted for anywhere in the world. In fact, the initiative is set to expand to Asia, Africa and the Middle East in 2025, creating a global network of empowered practitioners.\" Heba Azer, Maternal Program lead at Nestlé Nutrition Institute (NNI) Also, because the program content has been developed by academic partners, its focus remains on empowering healthcare practitioners.\nPrograms like this are vital in building healthier, stronger communities - and I am proud to be part of this journey.\nTogether, we're improving outcomes for mothers, families and communities, one informed conversation at a time.\n21 Creating Shared Value at Nestlé 2024 Creating Shared Value People, Families and Pets People and Planet People in Communities People and Planet 22 Creating Shared Value at Nestlé 2024 Creating Shared Value People, Families and Pets People and Planet People in Communities Our progress at a glance* 20.38% net GHG 21.3% sourced from farmers 95.3% renewable electricity emission adopting regenerative sourced in Nestlé's reduction agricultural practices manufacturing sites vs. 2018 baseline By 2025, we aim to source 2025 100% renewable 2024 2025 2030 2050 electricity in all our manufacturing sites We aim to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 from 2018 levels, on the road to net zero By 2025, we aim for 20% of our key ingredients by 2050 at the latest to be sourced from farmers adopting regenerative 21.3% virgin plastic reduction agricultural practices, and 50% by 2030 vs. 2018 baseline 8.2 million m3 volumetric 93.5% assessed water benefits delivered deforestation-free By 2025, we aim to reduce by implementing local virgin plastics by one third water stewardship versus our 2018 baseline projects The Nestlé Waters Regeneration Pledge aims to help nature retain 2.72 million m3 water more water than the business use reduction uses in all its operations by 2025 We aim to achieve and maintain 100% assessed in manufacturing deforestation-free primary supply chains: meat, palm sites in 2024 oil, pulp and paper, soy, sugar, cocoa** and coffee** * For information on our progress, see our Non-Financial Statement 2024. ** by 2025 23 Creating Shared Value at Nestlé 2024 Creating Shared Value People, Families and Pets People and Planet People in Communities Nestlé intends to have a resilient Our Good for the Planet strategy helps ensure we play our aim to ensure that all actors across our supply chain part in addressing key challenges like climate change, can benefit.

We also supported the creation of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform's Regenerating Together tool, which we are trialling. This is part of the collective effort needed to define a robust and harmonized framework to help measure progress in scaling up regenerative agriculture across the industry.\nWe understand that shifting from traditional practices to new ways of farming can be difficult, which is why we follow a holistic approach that includes finance and incentives, training, and creating market demand for ingredients grown on farms that have adopted regenerative agriculture practices.

Dairy ingredients are widely used across our portfolio and are our largest source of GHG emissions. We've created a dedicated Dairy Climate Plan, as a part of our Net Zero Roadmap, to reduce our dairy-related emissions.\nWorking with more than 200 suppliers across 27 different countries, the plan aims to reduce the main sources of GHG emissions at farm level: feed production, enteric methane and manure. Since each of our dairy farmers is unique, there is no single solution that can be applied across the dairy industry; we need to take a f armer-centric approach.\nOur plan includes five large-scale strategic initiatives: farmer engagement, low-carbon feed acceleration, At Skimmelkrans farm in South Africa, the farm employs manure management, digitalization and co-financing.\nregenerative practices such as soil fertility management.\nThe plan is supported by the Nestlé Institute of Agricultural Sciences and other external partnerships to help identify new, scientifically proven solutions which can help further accelerate the decarbonization of dairy in the future.\nTHE 5 PILLARS OF OUR DAIRY CLIMATE STRATEGY 35 Creating Shared Value at Nestlé 2024 Creating Shared Value People, Families and Pets People and Planet People in Communities EMPOWERING DAIRY FARMERS FOR CLIMATE ACTION IN CHINA by Liu Jianguo, Farm Management and Production Assessment System Manager of the Nestlé Qingdao Factory In China, we're pioneering innovative solutions to improve animal productivity and efficiency via feed solutions such as precision feeding and optimized feed formula and manure management. The goal is to cut the associated GHGs, including methane, produced by livestock.\nThrough the Nestlé Dairy Farming Institute in Greater China, we offer facilities to showcase sustainable, profitable agriculture, regenerative agricultural techniques and their corresponding emissions reductions.\nWorking with 36 farms across the country, we've introduced manure separators, a relatively simple but highly effective technology that separates solid from liquid manure. It is a process that allows farms to manage manure more efficiently and reduce methane.\nWe've also structured the financing in a novel way, with Nestlé, farmers and farm equipment suppliers each sharing a third of the cost of the separators. It is a partnership that not only minimizes costs but also ensures that the farms benefit from the byproducts. The solid manure can be used as fertilizer, creating an additional Through innovative solutions like manure separators and precision revenue stream.\nfeeding, farmers are cutting greenhouse gas emissions, improving productivity and creating additional revenue streams from organic fertilizer sales.

Long periods of drought, unexpected heavy rains and rising input costs have made it difficult to maintain a stable income.\nFor the past two and a half years, I have taken part in Nestlé's RegenTa initiative, which is part of the Nescafé Plan. It was introduced to help farmers like me adopt regenerative agriculture practices that make the farm more resilient to droughts and heavy rains, and to improve soil fertility, which also enhances our income and livelihood overall.\nThe program has opened my eyes to what is possible.\nI adopted intercropping, which involves planting crops such as chili, java long chili, pepper, odot grass, taro, and avocado trees alongside my coffee farm. This practice optimizes the use of my limited land and helps to prevent pests and diseases from spreading throughout my fields. It also increases soil fertility and reduces soil erosion. Cultivating diverse crops provides better conditions for pollinators and natural predators, which keep my farm productive and healthy. Additionally, with the support of the German Government Development Agency GIZ* as a partner through the Farmer Business School, I have been able to improve my entrepreneurial knowledge, further enhancing my farming practices and overall business acumen.\nThe bees help pollinate Agus' coffee plants, Farmer Agus checks the goats he has raised in his The cash crops also provide additional income throughout while the honey they produce is used as demonstration plot.

I also plant shading trees that produce pepper and java long chili. In dry season conditions, shade helps to prevent coffee plants from wilting.\nThe RegenTa project has had a major impact on me and my family. I can optimize my income from my coffee farm because I have implemented intercropping and sustainable farming practices. The changes I've made on my small farm have made me more resilient to face future challenges, even with unpredictable weather.\n* Nescafé and GIZ cooperate in Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Côte d'Ivoire with the aim of improving the resilience and income of smallholder coffee farmers.\n49 Creating Shared Value at Nestlé 2024 Creating Shared Value People, Families and Pets People and Planet People in Communities DELIVERING ON OUR PROMISE book, we hope you see a business deeply committed to making a difference.
