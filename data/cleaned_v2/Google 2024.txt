Our sustainability strategy We believe Google has a unique opportunity that extends beyond managing the environmental impact of our own operations and value chain. Our products, which are used by billions of people every day, can enable decisions that drive positive action for the environment. The figure below illustrates these two pillars of our sustainability strategy, supported by our dedication to accessible information and technological innovation. To learn more about our sustainability governance, stakeholder engagement, environmental data, and more, see the Appendix.
Our products Our operations We're empowering people with information to mitigate and adapt We're working to drive sustainability across our operations in four key ways: to climate change - focusing on sectors like energy and transportation accelerating the transition to a net-zero carbon future, advancing water stewardship, where Google's unique capabilities can have a meaningful impact. building a circular economy, and restoring nature and biodiversity.

Google Trends 30 show that the world is searching for sustainability information and insights like never before. For example in 2023, search interest in "jobs related to sustainability" reached an all-time high. 31 In fact, we estimate that 36% of Google Search users in the United States have searched for a sustainability-related topic over the course of a year. 32 Below are trends that demonstrate the impact climate change is having around the world, and what people are searching for to better understand it.

The Pact sets targets in five areas: energy efficiency, renewables, water, Climate Neutral Data circular economy, and heat recovery. In 2023, we successfully completed third-party verification that our Centre Pact (CNDCP) five Google-owned and -operated data centers in the EU met the five pact targets in line with the Self-Regulatory Initiative.
