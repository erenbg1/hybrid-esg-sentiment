Due to the energy crisis in Europe, people, businesses, and governments across the continent are concerned about rising prices and increased pressure on the energy grid, which is evident from the information they're searching for.
In 2022, we worked with the IEA to rapidly develop a set of recommendations to help individuals reduce energy use at home.

This reporting includes construction include the incorporation of water-efficient data on water withdrawal, consumption, and discharge - fixtures, such as faucets, toilets, and irrigation systems. all water withdrawn from all sources (e.g., surface water, These design standards also address replacing old fixtures groundwater, rainwater, municipal water supply, and with highly efficient ones in any space we move into, and trucked water), the portion of water permanently lost in the installing water meters with automatic leak detection.
